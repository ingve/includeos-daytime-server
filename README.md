# includeos-daytime-server

Implementation of the [Daytime Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Protocol) ([RFC 867](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc867)).

Requires [IncludeOS](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS). (This service currently requires the dev branch, but will be updated to work with an official IncludeOS release version once the required facilities have been merged).
